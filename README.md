# ZMK Corne Keymap

Keymap for Corne keyboard.
Created with [ZMK](https://zmkfirmware.dev/).  
Inspired by the [Miryoku layout by Manna Harbour](https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org).
And largely inspired by [Jason config](https://github.com/jasoneliu/zmk-config) for the base config (thanks you :3).
Thanks to [keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor) that makes life easier sometimes.

## Features

- Split, column-staggered, 6x3+3 layout
- Homerow modifiers (shift, control, alt, super)
- Numpad
- Navigation keys
- Media keys
- Bluetooth
- French layer accent
- Macro helper
- base layer switcher with combo (Qwerty & Gaming (no home row) and more a bit later ...)
